            <h2>The Key Principles of Stoicism</h2>
            <p>
                Although little of the Stoics' original writings exist, many Romans adopted the philosophy as a way of life or art of living (téchnê peri tón bion in the ancient Greek)—as it was intended by the Greeks—and it is from the complete documents of imperial period Romans, especially the writings of Seneca (4 BCE–65 CE), Epictetus (c. 55–135 CE) and Marcus Aurelius (121–180 CE) that we gain most of our information about the ethical system of the original Stoics.
                Today, Stoic principles have found their way into accepted popular wisdom, as goals to which we should aspire—as in the Serenity Prayer of Twelve Step addiction programs.

            <div>In "The Meditations," Marcus Aurelius reflects on various Stoic principles and ideas, including:</div>           
            <ul>
                <li>Acceptance of the Present: Marcus emphasizes the importance of accepting the present moment, acknowledging that it is the only reality we can control.</li>
                <li>Virtue as the Highest Good: He underscores the Stoic belief that virtue is the highest good, and living a virtuous life leads to true happiness.</li>
                <li>The Dichotomy of Control: Marcus distinguishes between things that are within our control (our thoughts, choices, and actions) and those that are not (external events and circumstances). He advises focusing on the former and accepting the latter with equanimity.</li>
                <li>Impermanence and Change: He reflects on the impermanent nature of all things, teaching that we should not become attached to material possessions or fleeting pleasures.</li>
                <li>Duty and Civic Responsibility: Marcus emphasizes the importance of fulfilling one's duty and civic responsibilities, even in the face of adversity.</li>
                <li>Mindfulness and Self-Examination: He encourages introspection and self-examination to better understand one's thoughts and emotions and to align them with reason and virtue.</li>
                <li>Compassion and Empathy: Marcus advocates for compassion and empathy toward others, recognizing our shared humanity.</li>
                <li>Fate and Providence: While acknowledging the role of fate, he emphasizes that individuals have the power to choose how they respond to external events.</li>
                <li>Moderation and Self-Discipline: He promotes moderation in all things and the practice of self-discipline to avoid excesses.</li>
                <li>Contemplation of Death: Marcus often contemplates the inevitability of death, urging readers to live each day as if it were their last and to focus on leaving a legacy of virtue.</li>
            </ul>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Nature:</strong> Nature is rational.</li>
                <li><strong>Law of Reason:</strong> The universe is governed by the law of reason. Humans can't actually escape its inexorable force, but they can, uniquely, follow the law deliberately.</li>
                <li><strong>Virtue:</strong> A life led according to rational nature is virtuous.</li>
                <li><strong>Wisdom:</strong> Wisdom is the root virtue. From it spring the cardinal virtues: insight, bravery, self-control, and justice.</li>
                <li><strong>Apathea:</strong> Since passion is irrational, life should be waged as a battle against it. Intense feeling should be avoided.</li>
                <li><strong>Pleasure:</strong> Pleasure is neither good nor bad. It is only acceptable if it doesn't interfere with the quest for virtue.</li>
                <li><strong>Evil:</strong> Poverty, illness, and death are not evil.</li>
                <li><strong>Duty:</strong> Virtue should be sought, not for the sake of pleasure, but for duty.</li>
