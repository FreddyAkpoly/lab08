            <p><strong>Marcus Aurelius Antoninus was a Roman emperor from 161 to 180 AD, 
                a Stoic philosopher, and a member of the Nervaâ€“Antonine dynasty.</strong> 
                He was the last of the rulers known as the Five Good
                Emperors and presided over the end of the Pax Romana, 
                a period of relative peace and stability in the Roman Empire lasting from 27 BC to 180 AD.
                He also held the position of Roman consul in 140, 145, and 161.
            </p>
            

    
            <p> Marcus was born in Rome on 26 April 121. 
                His birth name is sometimes given as Marcus Annius Verus,
                but sources assign this name to him upon his father's death and unofficial adoption by his grandfather,
                upon his coming of age.[He may have been known as <em>"Marcus Annius Catilius Severus"</em>. 
                Upon his adoption by Antoninus as heir to the throne, he was known as "Marcus Aelius Aurelius Verus Caesar" and,
                upon his ascension, he was "Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus" until his death
            </p>
            <p> Marcus Aurelius had a diverse family background. His paternal family, the gens Annia, had Roman Italo-Hispanic origins, with claims of descent from Numa Pompilius. They moved to Ucubi in Iberian Baetica and rose to prominence in Rome in the late 1st century AD. Marcus's great-grandfather was a senator, and his grandfather was made patrician. 
                He was also related to the Nerva-Antonine dynasty through his grandmother.
                On his mother's side, Marcus's mother, Domitia Lucilla Minor (Domitia Calvilla), came from a wealthy Roman patrician family with substantial assets in Rome, including brickworks and a villa on the Caelian hill.  
                Marcus was born and raised in the Horti Domitia Calvillae and had a deep connection to the Caelian hill.    
                Marcus was adopted into the Roman Italo-Gallic gens Aurelia at the age of 17 by Antoninus Pius, who hailed from the Aurelii Fulvi, a branch of the Aurelii with roots in Roman Gaul.
