            <h2>The Stoics</h2>
            <p><strong>The Stoics are one of five major philosophical schools in classical Greece and Rome: Platonist, Aristotelian, Stoic, Epicurean, and Skeptic.</strong> 
                 The philosophers who followed Aristotle (384–322 BCE) were also known as the Peripatetics, named for their habit of walking around the colonnades of the Athenian Lyceum. 
                 The Stoic philosophers, on the other hand, were named for the Athenian Stoa Poikile or "painted porch," the roofed colonnade in Athens where the founder of the Stoic philosophy, 
                 Zeno of Citium (344–262 BC), held his classes.
            </p>
        
                <h2>The Stoics</h2>
                <div class="wrap">
                    <img src="./images/stoics.jpg" alt="Socrates statue">
                </div>
            
                <p>According to tradition, Marcus was a Stoic. His ancient biographer, 
                    Julius Capitolinus, describes him as such.
                     Marcus also makes reference to a number of Stoics by whom he was taught and, in particular, 
                     mentions Rusticus from whom he borrowed a copy of the works of the Stoic philosopher Epictetus (Med. 1.7).
                      However, nowhere in the Meditations does Marcus explicitly call himself a Stoic. 
                      This may simply reflect the likelihood that Marcus was writing only for himself rather than attempting to define himself to an audience. 
                    Yet it is probably fair to admit that Marcus was at least open to ideas from other philosophical traditions, being impressed by Stoic philosophy, but not merely an unthinking disciple of Stoicism.
                </p>
                <p>As has been noted, Marcus was clearly familiar with the Discourses of Epictetus,
                    quoting them a number of times (see Med. 11.33-38). Epictetus’ 
                    fame in the second century is noted by a number of ancient sources, being hailed as the greatest of the Stoics 
                    (Aulus Gellius 1.2.6) and more popular than Plato (Origen Contra Celsus 6.2).
                     If Marcus felt drawn towards Stoicism, 
                     then Epictetus would surely have stood out as the most important Stoic of the time. It is perhaps reasonable, then,
                     to turn to Epictetus in order to explore the philosophical background to the Meditations.
                </p>
                <p>Marcus Aurelius faced numerous challenges during his reign, including wars, political intrigue, and plagues.
                     Despite these difficulties, he remained committed to Stoic principles,
                      emphasizing the importance of virtue, resilience in the face of adversity, and the acceptance of fate.
                    His writings continue to be widely read and respected in modern times,
                     making him one of the most famous Stoic philosophers in history. Stoicism, as a philosophy, 
                     also enjoys a resurgence of interest in contemporary society, 
                     as its principles offer practical guidance for dealing with the challenges of everyday life.
