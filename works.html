            <h2>The Works Of An Emperor</h2>
            <p><strong>  Aside from the Meditations Marcus’ extant works include some edicts, official letters, and some private correspondence, including a lengthy correspondence with his rhetoric  teacher and lifelong friend, Fronto.</strong> 
             The private correspondence began before Marcus was twenty and continued into his imperial years.
              It includes what seem to be rhetorical exercises (for example, pieces in praise of sleep, and smoke and dust) written when Marcus was still in his 20s, 
              an exchange about the value or disvalue of rhetoric to philosophy written soon after Marcus became Emperor, and throughout, personal information, 
              frequently concerning illnesses, births, and deaths in his own family.

            <p>A more intimate contact with the thoughts pursued by Marcus during the troubling involvements of his reign, 
                though not what would have been historically most valuable, his day-to-day political thoughts, 
                can be acquired by reading the Meditations. To what extent he intended them for eyes other than his own is uncertain;
                 they are fragmentary notes, discursive and epigrammatic by turn, of his reflections in the midst of campaigning and administration. In a way, it seems, he wrote them to nerve himself for his daunting responsibilities. Strikingly, though they comprise the innermost thoughts of a Roman,
                  the Meditations were written in Greek—to such an extent had the union of cultures become a reality. 
                 In many ages these thoughts have been admired; the modern age, however, is more likely to be struck by the pathology of them, their mixture of priggishness and hysteria.
                  Marcus was forever proposing to himself unattainable goals of conduct, forever contemplating the triviality, brutishness, and transience of the physical world and of humanity in general and himself in particular; otherworldly,
                  yet believing in no other world, he was therefore tied to duty and service with no hope, even of everlasting fame, to sustain him. Sickly all through his life and probably plagued with a chronic ulcer, he took daily doses of a drug; the suggestion has been made that the apocalyptic imagery of passages in the Meditations betrays the addict. 
                  More certain and more important is the point that Marcus’s anxieties reflect, in an exaggerated manner, the ethos of his age.
            </p>
            <p>The Meditations, the thoughts of a philosopher-king, have been considered by many generations one of the great books of all times. 
                Although they were Marcus’s own thoughts, they were not original. 
                They are basically the moral tenets of Stoicism, learned from Epictetus: the cosmos is a unity governed by an intelligence,
                 and the human soul is a part of that divine intelligence and can therefore stand,
                  if naked and alone, at least pure and undefiled, amid chaos and futility. One or two of Marcus’s ideas, 
                  perhaps more through lack of rigorous understanding than anything else, 
                  diverged from Stoic philosophy and approached that Platonism that was itself then turning into the Neoplatonism into which all pagan philosophies, except Epicureanism,
                   were destined to merge. But he did not deviate so far as to accept the comfort of any kind of survival after death.
            </p>

            <p>The book is divided into 12 chapters, often referred to as "books,"
                 each containing various short passages or aphorisms. 
                 The organization is not thematic but rather reflects the order of Marcus Aurelius's 
                 thoughts and reflections at different times.
                 Throughout the book, Marcus Aurelius provides practical advice on how to live a good and meaningful life.
                  He encourages self-examination, self-control,
                   and a focus on the things within one's control while accepting what is beyond one's control.
